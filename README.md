# Return true to win

This is a clone of the great online game [return true to win](https://alf.nu/ReturnTrue). 
I made this because the website has been down for a while and I loved playing that game.

You can visit the website here: https://acheronfail.github.io/rttw/

### Current Limitations

This is just run in the browser, there's no server. That means that your solutions are saved in
localStorage and (for the time being) cannot be transferred from one computer/browser to another. 
In the future hopefully there'll be a server, which can also verify the solutions in other browsers
as well to make the experience more consistent. Having this will also give us the ability to add 
things like high scores, userdata (saving currently input solutions, previous solutions, etc) and
other such goodness.
